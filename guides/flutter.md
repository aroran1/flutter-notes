# What is Flutter?

Flutter is a tool that allows you to build "native cross-platform" (iOS, Android (and web) which will get distributed by App store / Google Play Store) apps with one programming language (instaed of Swift /  Objective C for apple apps and Java / Kotlin app wrapped with Android wrapper ) and having a singular codebase.

- Flutter is a SDK (software development kit) - a tool to compile your app (dart / flutter ) code to native machine code and develop with ease instead of handling multiple code bases. Currently there is not 1 language that would work on both platforms.

- A framework / widget library - which is used to build bueatiful flutter apps. It peovides you with re-uasable building blocks ( = widgets / utility functions, packages). It helps you build what your user see and they interact with. This code will then get compiled into native app code with the help of SDK.

## Dart

Flutter uses a programming language called Dart which is focused on building Frontend (mobile / web apps) user interface (UI) development.

Dart is a programming language craeted by Google (same as flutter). Dart is a object-oriented and a strongly types language. Its syntax is a mixture of Javascript, Java, C# (but you don't need to know them upfront).
