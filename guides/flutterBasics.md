# Flutter Basics
- Create a new project with `flutter create flutter_basic_app`
- open `Android Studio` > open an existing project and select android folder
  - we are only using `Android Studio` for emulator
  - craete a new device for the project and click play
- VS Code 
  - User terminal to run the project
  - You can run project with or without debugging mode
    - Run > Start Debugging
    - Run > Without Debugging > select > Dart & Flutter. This will build the project with the help of SDK.
    - You also have access to control bar
- Go back to emulator and see your app is loaded in it

## Project folder structure
- .idea - holds configuration for android studio. No need to change as we are not using that IDE.
- .vscode - holds configuration for VS Code IDE
- android - This is the folder where Android app will be compiled to its native code. You shouldn't need to change anything in there.
- iOS - This is the folder where iOS app will be compiled to its native code. You shouldn't need to change anything in there. This folder is not available on windows as you can't build an iOS app from windows machine. This is in essence the xcode project which is created and managed by flutter. 
- build - this holds the output of your flutter application. This is generated and managed by flutter SDK so you shouldn't have to make any changes there.
- lib - lib is the coding folder (important for us) for us where we will be craeting our dart files and craeting our project code
- test - is for writing test cases for the project
- .metadata - again this file is nmanaged by flutter and save some information that widgets need to build our application correectly
- .packages - again generated by Flutter SDK  and to mannge internal dependency. Don't change and don't remove.
- <AppName>.iml - again generated by Flutter SDK and to mannge internal dependency and some project settings. We will not be changing this file.
- pubspec.lock / pubspec.yml - we will be using as to manage 3rd party dependencies that we need for our project, configure fonts, images etc. Code will be written in yml and will generate the relevant .lock file (but holds more details information ), same as package.json config file in a node project


## Dart
- Dart is a typed language which helps maintain the incoming and resul ting data types and catches any errors early on
  - Types:
    - Text
      -String
    - Number
      - fntegers - numbers without decimal
      - floats / double - decimal numbers (can also accept a whole numbe and converts it to double (as a decimal) to return the value)
      - num - aloows both  int and doubles
- variable can be assigned with var or a type keyword
- void is a type to show that a function returns nothing
- main is a special function name as its get called automatically in a file 
- main.dart file is the main file that gets called automatically when the app starts so when you put main function in amin.dart will be the first function your app calls
- use camel cased function names, use the name to describe its fucntionaly to make it easier for others to understand it
- Dart is a object oriented language. Everything in dart is a object, meaning everything is in object data structure which is used by dart internally, ie 1 is also an object which has some additional info. Object also helps the relation between different datas, ie name and age individually may not be obviously related if stored individually.
  - To create an object you need to create a blueprint of it to tell dart how object looks like, this can be done by `class`. Give a name to a class starting with a capital letter
  class Person {
    String name = 'Max';
    int age = 30; 
  }
  - the you will craete an instance of that class Person by `var p1 = Person()` // new keyword with Person is not required in Dart which will instantiate that class instance and the you can access the properties of that class object by `p1.age` 
```
// 1
void addNumber(int a, double b) {
  print(a + b);
}

// 2
double addNumber(double a, double b) {
  return a + b;
}

void main() { 
  print(addNumber(2, 5.5)); // throws error with 1 as it doesn't return anything
  print(addNumber(2, 5.5)); // 7.5 with 2

  var result = addNumber(2, 5.5); // craeting a variable, it could also be double result = ... as its value type is infered to the variable but its best practise to use var

  for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print('Hello ${i + 1}')
  }
}
// OUTPUT
hello 1
hello 2
hello 3
hello 4
hello 5
```
